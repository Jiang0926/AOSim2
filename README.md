# AOSim2
MATLAB-based Adaptive Optics simulation

Most of this code is the property of Johanan L. Codona, Ph.D. Some code is included from the MathWorks web site to compute Zernike polynomials and Mark Milton's code to compute disk harmonics.
Also included is mfitsio for convenience. I will try to clean up parts of this repo wrt licenses. If in doubt, ask.
